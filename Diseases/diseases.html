                            Cardiovascular disease (CVD) often affects the heart and blood vessels CVD is often caused by artery blockages or clots. It can damage organs like the brain, heart, kidneys, and eyes but is largely preventable through a healthy lifestyle.

                            Cancer is a condition where cells in a specific part of the body grow and reproduce uncontrollably. The cancerous cells can invade and destroy surrounding healthy tissue, including organs.
Cancer can sometimes begin in one part of the body before spreading to other areas. This process is known as metastasis. The NHS states that 1 in 2 people will develop some form of cancer during their lifetime.

                            Chronic respiratory diseases are diseases of the airways and other structures of the lung. The most common are asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), occupational lung diseases and pulmonary hypertension. In addition to tobacco smoke, other risk factors include air pollution, occupational chemicals and dusts, and frequent lower respiratory infections during childhood.

                            Managing cardiovascular disease involves lifestyle changes like a healthier diet, more exercise, and quitting smoking or vaping. Treatment may include medications, procedures like stents or heart surgery, and cardiac rehabilitation to strengthen the heart. In some cases, regular monitoring without immediate treatment is recommended as it is less invasive.

                            The goal of cancer treatment is to cure the disease and help you live a typical lifespan, though this depends on your specific situation. If a cure isn't possible, treatments aim to shrink or slow the cancer, helping you live symptom-free for as long as possible. Treatments may include primary therapy, such as surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy, to eliminate the cancer; adjuvant therapy to destroy remaining cells and reduce recurrence risk; or neoadjuvant therapy to improve the effectiveness of the primary treatment. Another type of care is palliative care. This type of care focuses on improving quality of life by relieving pain and symptoms, often alongside more aggressive treatments.

                            Unfortunately, there is no cure for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but certain types of treatments can slow its progression and manage symptoms. Key treatments include stopping smoking, which is crucial for anyone with COPD who smokes, inhalers and tablets to ease breathing, and pulmonary rehabilitation, this is a program that combines exercise and education. In some cases, surgery or a lung transplant may be considered, though this is only an option for a small number of people.
